# âœ… Eligibility Criteria:
# Student must pass all subjects (Maths, Physics, Chemistry).

# Minimum marks in each subject should be >= 35.

# If all marks are above 35:

# If average is >= 75: Print "Eligible for Scholarship Admission!"

# Else: Print "Eligible for Admission without Scholarship."

# If failed in any subject (marks < 35): Print "Not eligible for Admission!"




# Task no 3 

# ðŸ”¸ Task : Eligibility for Driving License
# Write a program that asks the user their age, and:

# If age is below 0 or above 120 â†’ Print: Invalid age entered!

# If age is between 0â€“17 â†’ Print: Not eligible for a driving license.

# If age is 18â€“60 â†’ Print: Eligible for a driving license.

# If age is 61â€“80 â†’ Print: Eligible with a medical certificate.

# If age is above 80 â†’ Print: Too old for a new driving license.
